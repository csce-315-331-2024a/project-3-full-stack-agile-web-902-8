The goal of this first sprint is to set a foundation for our software. We will focus on creating templates for our interfaces as well as choosing design layouts. In addition we will work on connecting our database to our program and convert our backend java files to Javascript files for our webpage. By the end of the sprint we should have a runnable program.
