The goal of the second sprint is to connect the already implemented interfaces with full functionality. We will create the missing pages in the customer and manager interface with their functionality so we have a fully implemented program. In addition We will implement our APIs that will help us with our personas we are accounting for. By the end of the sprint we will be able to access each feature and have full functionality to some extent.
