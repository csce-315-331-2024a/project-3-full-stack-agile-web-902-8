The goal of the second sprint is to connect the already implemented interfaces with full functionality (edit, remove, add, etc).
We will create the missing pages in the customer and manager interface with their functionality (mostly statstics information) so we have a fully implemented program.
In addition We will implement our APIs that will help us with our personas we are accounting for (touch interaction, text to audio, transalation).
By the end of the sprint we will be able to access each feature and have full functionality with features to help our personas.

Number of tasks: 20
Total number of points: 52
